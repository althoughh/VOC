Our account rep Beth is also super responsive and helpful. I've had companies like Checkr and Goodhire run me around for weeks without proper response/demos. Easier to understand the pricing structure as well! Less clunky than some of the software provided by stodgy/huge background check companies. Great for modern/cutting-edge tech companies.
Zinc is great, this is more of a general comment for all background check providers. It would be great if there were guidance/available documentation on standard SOC2 compliance regulations so companies who need to be compliant can easily reference them.

13,sterling-talent-solutions,United States,0.0,Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing,mid-market,"I do like that we can see more detail as different checks are being completed.
Where to even begin. Customer service is extremely lacking. They will try to tell you something in the software isn't acting up until you send proof. They will boot your preferred drug testing location without a heads up (which was a nightmare and took months to get set up in the first place). Oh and on the second random place they sent our candidate, they lost the sample, which is inexcusable and pushed hiring back several weeks. We're lucky we didn't lose the candidate since Sterling's support told him it was still being tested (nope, never got to the lab). Finally, they will close a case as completed even if something wasn't done, as in the case of the missing drug test. Instead of reaching out to us directly to explain the mishap, they told the applicant it had been lost and marked the check as complete and to ""consider"" the drug test results. Completely unacceptable.

There is virtually no Customer Service available. Employment and education verification work is not done by Sterling but rather outsourced to the candidate. Responses and requests are automated and it is impossible to get through to a real person. Even after providing the documentation requested by them, it is not noted properly in the final report. Because they don't make the effort to actually verify information other than criminal history, despite providing the requested documentation for other information, it will still be counted against you as they technically didn't verify it themselves. I would assume it is hard to verify anything when you don't even attempt to actually contact the points of contact provided.

For example, for background checks, we have to submitted the document stating we have the authorisation to do a search. It was not mandatory with other platforms or companies. At first, it seems like a hassle. But in definitive, it serves as a fail safe because it is anyway a regulation we need to respect.
Certn enables us to complete our recruitment processes faster than we used to. It has contributed to better overall performance.

To make things absolutely worse you have to provide all of the documents for the background check. Who has to provide all the documents for a background check?

174,certn,Canada,4.5,Mining & Metals,enterprise,"Certn is an all-in-one background check platform that is both cost-effective and expedient. Because candidates upload their own government ID's for biometric-based identity verification and criminal background/public safety check, you don't have to wait for the candidate to upload multiple documents. They fill everything out online and can be done in as little as 5 minutes, while the background checks themselves are usually complete within 1-2 business days.

The reference check is equally simple and efficient as an automated email is instantly sent to the referees upon the candidate submitting their contact info; referees simply follow the link to complete their reference and because the questions are highly specific, it usually only takes 5-7 minutes to complete while providing a comprehensive assessment of the candidate's performance during their reporting tenure. 

If you need any help at all, Certn has a wonderfully responsive Live Chat feature that makes it easy to reach out to an expert who can resolve any potential roadblocks or guide you towards a proper solution. 

I've used other providers such as: Sterling, HireRight, FirstAdvantage, amongst others and I can confidently state that Certn is wonderfully simple, quick and user-friendly while being price competitive.
The reference template can be submitted by the referee without actually completing the entire form; this occasionally happens, which means the employer must reach out to Certn to re-open the document and re-invite the referee to complete their reference. There should be a mechanism to prevent referees from submitting the form without completing all required fields.
Certn has helped our organization significantly improve the turnaround time for our background checks. As a high-growth software and technology company, this is vital to secure niche talent and to turn around an offer letter quickly. It's a candidates' market right now and Certn enables us to be more agile while improving our workflow since it seamlessly integrates with our cloud-based ATS. There are no more chasing referees or candidates for missing info - Certn has streamlined the process and will follow-up with candidates immediately for any missing elements. Their biometric verification and secure hosting means that our company can feel confident about the talent that we've hired.

The applicant experience is pretty straightforward for our applicants to complete. There are not too many questions on how to complete it. It is also helpful that it can be accessed via mobile device as some of our applicants only have access to a mobile phone. There are some minor challenges with getting the selfie image quality check completed due to lighting and other issue, but majority of applicants get through that portion.

The turnaround time for the checks is quick and efficient. Even in situations where follow-ups are required, they are completed promptly and efficiently. 

The customer support is always responsive and helpful. Also, it's always nice to talk to such friendly people who are eager to help with using the product!
The knowledge database can be enhanced with more answers so that it does not always require reaching to customer support for help. The categorization of the topics in the knowledge database is also very confusing, so sometimes, I'm not clear on if I'm looking up the correct information relevant for my product or if it is for other Certn product. 

There are some instances of checks being in limbo with no clear indication of steps to remedy or indicating that a follow-up task is initiated. This leads to jumping to contacting customer support for when the checks are required in a more timely manner. 

Looking forward to more additional customization/design options that can help improve the applicant experience, such as changing the application completion screen or messaging to provide further instructions to the applicant. That will help us tailor the experience for our applicants.
Both credit and identity check for property management and real estate transactions. This solution brings all that information into a single report that can be easily consumed by our Approval team.

The customer service team cannot talk directly by calling or Instant Messaging or communicating directly in any way to the employment verification team. 

The employment verification team used a phone number to verify employment as the default method of verification during a pandemic when team members around the world are almost all working from home. Then once the customer service team was notified by phone that email should be used to verify employment the message, the message did not get relayed to the employment verification team and phone was still used. The case was then closed and it was determined that employment could not be verified even though they only had used telephone to verify and not email. Once a case is closed Sterling does not go back and try to verify employment. There is no flexible process to incorporate new information into a file either before and especially after a case is ""closed"" even if there was an error in the process along the way. 

The process is very robotic, not smart and streamlined, bureaucratic, inefficient, not centralized, impersonal and slow. There is not sense of accountability that I feel that the organization cares for my time or wants to solve my problems quickly. The technology and databases are not connected from the call center to the internal employment verification teams.

330,checkr,United States,1.0,Real Estate,mid-market,"One of the standout features of Checkr's platform is its user-friendly interface, which made it easy for our administrators to navigate and manage the screening process. The platform's intuitive design and well-organized sections allowed both the admins and employees to swiftly enter and access the information needed. Checkr's screening process itself is also relatively quick.
Please note that all of the 5-star reviewers for Checkr are tagged as being ""Incentivized."" Please also note that the majority of the 0-3 star reviews were not incentivized by Checkr. Their competitive pricing played a significant role in our decision to engage with Checkr to begin with. Initially, Checkr provided us with a quote that seemed reasonable for the standard 10-panel drug test we requested. We proceeded with the setup, believing we had found a cost-effective solution. However, our optimism quickly turned to dismay when we reviewed our billing statements and discovered that Checkr was charging us double the amount we were initially quoted for the drug test.

Upon bringing this discrepancy to the attention of their billing team, we received a copy of our Master Services Agreement (MSA) where, to our dismay, we found a completely different drug test than we discussed listed on the MSA (also a 10-panel but for different substances). They stated that the one we had been ordering (the one we actually requested and were set up to order) was $25 more than the one listed in our MSA. Aside from the fact that they are unable to tell me why they would put one drug test on our MSA and then set up our account with a completely different one, it's also important to note that both of these 10-panel tests cost the same at two of the largest testing companies in the U.S. (Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics). It became evident that this alternative drug test, which we had neither requested nor discussed, was used by Checkr to justify the inflated billing rate. This reliance on a typographical error in their own documentation was both disingenuous and unacceptable.

Despite clearly stating that our account was set up to run the test we had originally requested, Checkr refused to acknowledge their mistake and refund the overbilled amount. To make matters worse, during the renewal process, they attempted to double the cost of the test. It was only when I pointed out that their MSA explicitly stated no pricing increase for a full year after the initial term that they reluctantly reverted to the original pricing. This blatant attempt to take advantage of our oversight was deeply disappointing and indicative of their unscrupulous practices.

It may seem like a good switch to save money but it is absolutely not worth it. The combination of unreliable billing practices, a refusal to rectify mistakes, and an attempt to exploit customers demonstrates a severe lack of integrity on the part of Checkr. I strongly advise against wasting your time and money on this company. Instead, invest in a reputable service provider that values transparency and adheres to agreed-upon pricing.

Save yourself the frustration and explore other options

Occasionally, candidates may get ""stuck"" in the process of updating personal information.

Having said that, Checkr has always been quick to step in and help us resolve any such issues.

During the initial setup of Checkr, I had to go back and forth with customer service in order to get the reports/checks combined the way I wanted them to be.  For example, our finance team required both a credit and a standard new employee background check.  Per Checkr's policies, I was unable to run two different reports on the same employee within a certain window.  (I believe it was either 14 or 30 days, but this situation occurred about 2 years ago).  With the help of customer service, they were able to combine two searches into one ordered ""report"" so that we could get around this Checkr issue going forward.  Also, their standard report adds in educational verification (at an additional cost); if you are looking to run the standard, basic federal & county searches, make sure to call customer service to get this 'standard' add on removed (we do our own educational verification by requesting transcripts directly from universities).
Per our standard business processes, we need to run background checks as a condition of employment at our firm.  When switching from one PEO to another, we discovered that going through Checkr for this service directly would be more cost effective than having a PEO continue to run this process for us (i.e. both PEOs also used Checkr, but they were charging us an additional fee to manage the background checks.  We just cut out the middle man).
Be certain to get the reports configured the way that you'd like at the time of rollout - do not just go with the Checkr standard.

This makes running those reports frustrating and I have to do it several times until I guess exactly how they have the name in the system. Also some of the picky states like CA, WA and PA are not easy to run reports on. I wish they integrated the legal aspect into their releases so that we can just get it done.
